./kubectl expose deployment/awscpi --type="NodePort" --port 3000

1. the ports exposed in dockerfile needs to be same while exposing deployments

2. then nodeport assigns a auto port from 29000 to 32000

3. this port is actually the node ip

PS C:\Users\hemanth243> ./minikube.exe ip
192.168.99.101


4. this ip forwards the port from 

http://192.168.99.101:30376 to the pod endpoints

this is how service works
